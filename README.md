# Combination-of-YOLO-and-Segment-Anything

in this project we Combined the Yolo, Object Detector, with Segment anything prested by Meta or facebook.
in this project we first exxtract the candidate object regions by using Yolo and then we will pass the correspond ROI to Segment anything to extract the objetc.



## what is Object Detection?
Object detection is a computer technology related to computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class in digital images and videos. Well-researched domains of object detection include face detection and pedestrian detection.


## What is Yolo Family?
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a single-stage object detector introduced to achieve both goals (i.e., speed and accuracy). And today, we will give an introduction to the YOLO family by covering all the YOLO variants (e.g., YOLOv1, YOLOv2,â€¦, YOLOX, YOLOR).

## What is Segment anything?
The Segment Anything Model offers a powerful and versatile solution for object segmentation in images, enabling you to enhance your datasets with segmentation masks. With its fast processing speed and various modes of inference, SAM is a valuable tool for computer vision applications.
